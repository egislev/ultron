## ‚öôÔ∏è To run PHP in an optimized way, use the following commands:

To run it directly in the command line:

```bash
php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -d opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M -d opcache.jit=1255 -d memory_limit=-1 robot.php
```

For example, to run it in the background, you can use:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s robot 'cd /root/ultron && php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -d opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M -d opcache.jit=1255 -d memory_limit=-1 robot.php > /dev/tty1 && tmux detach-client'
```

These commands will help you run your PHP script with optimizations either in the foreground or in the background using tmux.

## üîß Requirements

Before utilizing ULTRON, please ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Latest version of **PHP** installed
- List of required **PHP modules** (specified at the end of the script)
- Properly configured radio software for optimal performance
- Recommendations for optimal usage:
  - Disable the Tx watchdog
  - Configure the UDP server to target the program's IP location
  - Enable transmission of logged QSO ADIF data
  - Do not filter UDP data
  - Adjust firewall settings to facilitate data flow

## üìã Details

- ULTRON operates in **real-time**, allowing seamless software switches without requiring restarts. It automatically detects your **call sign**, **IP address**, and communication ports.
- ULTRON uses its own **logbook**, but you can provide your own by placing it in the "**wsjtx_log.adi**" folder within ULTRON. This logbook remains separate from other software.
- In addition to calling CQ, ULTRON recognizes messages like **73** or **RR73** and determines if correspondents are busy or unresponsive.
- If a correspondent doesn't respond, they will be **waitlisted for 30 minutes** before a QSO retry.
- Signals weaker than **-20dB** are considered less likely to result in successful QSOs.
- The logged ADIF message is sent to ULTRON when the WSJT-X user accepts the "Log  QSO" dialog by clicking the "OK" button.

## üåà Terminal and Color Support

ULTRON requires a terminal with **ASCII color support**. You can use the **Linux terminal** or the new **Windows 10/11 terminal**, both of which support ASCII color. For color support on Windows, consider using [**ConEmu**](https://conemu.github.io/) for an enhanced experience.

## üçì Raspberry Pi

To control Raspberry Pi LEDs, use the `sudo` command configured without a password prompt. The **green LED** lights up for each decoding and turns off when inactive. The **red LED** exhibits a heartbeat-like effect during QSOs. Conducting a QSO emits an audible tone if a speaker is connected to the Pi's jack.

## üíª ULTRON Execution Instructions

To run ULTRON on both Windows and Linux, you have several options:

1. **Terminal Execution:**
   You can execute ULTRON directly through the terminal by running the following command: `php robot.php`

2. **Batch Script (Windows) or Shell Script (Linux):**
Alternatively, you can create a batch script (.BAT) for Windows or a shell script (.sh) for Linux with the necessary commands to execute ULTRON.

3. **Task Scheduler:**
You may also utilize a task scheduler to run ULTRON in the background upon system startup.

Please note the following important considerations:

- ULTRON requires specific modules. Please ensure that you have the required modules installed. Refer to the "robot.php" file for the list of requirements.
- Make necessary modifications to the "php.ini" configuration to meet the requirements of ULTRON.

For reference, an example "php.ini" configuration is provided in the "extras" folder.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thinking

Ultron was developed by me for me and some friends. It requires the user to have prior knowledge in using PHP and knowing how to use a Windows or Linux terminal. That's no longer up to me, but I guarantee you Ultron works very well. It can operate for years without the need for intervention.

**Why PHP!** Because it runs on any operating system and no compilation is needed. The script is just text with commands. Ultron will execute on any device that can run PHP (PC/CELLPHONE/ROUTER... ETC).

## üñ•Ô∏è Devices that Can Run PHP

- Personal Computers (PC) with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Smartphones and tablets with iOS, Android, etc.
- Web servers (Linux, Windows Server, etc.).
