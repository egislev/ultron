  This software can be controlled remotely or locally to manage<br>
  programs such as JTDX - MSHV - WSJT-X.<br>
 <br>
  It runs on Windows or Linux, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.<br>
  requires the latest version of PHP.<br>
 <br>
  Attention: The list of required PHP modules is located at the end of the script.<br>
  It is necessary that you adjust the radio software for its proper functioning.<br>
  Some recommendations:<br>
  Disable the Tx watchdog.<br>
  Set the UDP server to point to the IP where this program is located.<br>
  Enable sending logged QSO ADIF data.<br>
  Do not filter UDP data.<br>
  Adjust your firewall to allow data to pass through.<br>
 <br>
  It is necessary to use a terminal that supports ASCII color.<br>
  Both the Linux terminal and the new Windows 10 or 11 terminal support it.<br>
  If you cannot see colors in Windows,<br>
  I recommend using https://conemu.github.io/ for a better experience.<br>
 <br>
  To be able to control the LEDs of a Raspberry Pi, it is necessary to use sudo.<br>
  configured it so that it does not require a password.<br>
